- #### Country: Country where the user is located.
- #### Device Type: Type of device used by the user (Smart TV, Mobile, Desktop, Tablet).

## Project Objectives
### The primary objectives of this project are to:

- #### Analyze the distribution of new users joined over the period of time.
- #### Understand the geographic distribution of revenue generation.
- #### Identify trends with respect to user retention.
- #### Explore user activity patterns based on device types.
- #### Provide actionable insights to improve user engagement and revenue.
